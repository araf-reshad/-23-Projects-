## Instructions

Complete the function `set_of_duplicates()` so that it takes a list and returns the set of unique items that appear more than once in the list.

*Hint:* Consider using the list method `.count()`.

## Criteria
* The Unit Tests pass
* The function works exactly as described
* The docstring wasn't moved or removed
* Your function includes *at least one (1)* helpful line comment (the docstring doesn't count for this)
* You include at least 3 of your own tests.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

When these criteria are met and you answer the questions in **sources.md**, you may submit this assignment.

If you submit this task without meeting these criteria, you will be asked to redo it and resubmit it.

## main.py

Here is the original code in **main.py** for reference:

```python
def set_of_duplicates(lst):
  """Returns the set of all duplicate items in lst."""
  # What goes here?
  pass # Delete this line when you're done

# Include at least three other tests here
print(set_of_duplicates([])) # should print set()
```
