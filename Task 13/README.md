## Instructions

Complete the function `friday_13_months()` in **main.py** so that it takes a year (1970 or later) and returns the tuple of months that have a Friday the 13th in that year.

Here is an example:

```python
print(friday_13_months(1992))
# prints ("March", "November")
```

## Criteria
* The Unit Tests pass
* The function works exactly as described
* The docstring wasn't moved or removed
* Your function includes *at least one (1)* helpful line comment (the docstring doesn't count for this)

When these criteria are met and you answer the questions in **sources.md**, you may submit this assignment.

If you submit this task without meeting these criteria, you will be asked to redo it and resubmit it.

## main.py

def friday_13_months(year):
  """Returns the tuple of months that have a Friday the 13th in the given year. The months show up in order."""
  # What goes here?
  pass # Delete this line when you're done
```
