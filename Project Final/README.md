Goal: Create a classic rendition of the game “Minesweeper” which is a logic puzzle video game genre. The game features a grid of clickable cells, with hidden bombs scattered randomly throughout it. The player's objective is to clear the board without detonating any bombs. This is done with the help of clues that state the number of bombs that exist in each neighboring cell. 

Looking towards having the program print the layout of where the bombs are in the console and test each square for what it is. This will also test the bomb pop-up and the win pop-up. Since it is all randomized I would have it restart multiple times to see if it works.
