## Instructions

Complete the function `positive_product()` in the file **main.py** so that it returns the product of all the positive numbers in `num_list` (a list of numbers). If the list is empty or it does not contain any positive numbers, it returns `1`.

To check whether your function works, click on the checkmark on the left-hand side then click on **â–· Run Tests**.

**Reminder**: Zero is neither positive nor negative.

**Hint**: Look up what the *multiplicative identity* is.

## Criteria
* The Unit Tests pass
* The function works exactly as described
* The docstring wasn't moved or removed
* No modules are imported.
* Your function includes *at least one (1)* helpful line comment (the docstring doesn't count for this)

&nbsp;&nbsp;

When these criteria are met and you answer the questions in **sources.md**, you may submit this assignment.

If you submit this task without meeting these criteria, you will be asked to redo it and resubmit it.

## main.py

Here is the original code in **main.py** for reference:

```python
def positive_product(num_list):
  """Returns the product of all the positive numbers in num_list."""
  # What goes here?
  pass # Delete this line when you're done

# You can modify these to test whether your function works
print(positive_product([])) # should print 1
print(positive_product([-3, -1, -0.5, 0])) # should print 1
print(positive_product([2])) # should print 2
print(positive_product([2, 6])) # should print 12
print(positive_product([2, 6, -9])) # should print 12
```
