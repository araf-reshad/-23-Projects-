* Writing Plaintext Files Using the `print()` Function ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4dG0HS4OwE&list=PLVD25niNi0BnTo_MGI8NI6WvVIXcC9khH)|[note](https://github.com/Kitchener-Waterloo-Collegiate-and-VS/ICS3U/blob/main/Unit%204/4.03%20Writing%20Plaintext%20Files%20Using%20the%20print()%20Function.md))

## Instructions

Create a program that finds ways to write each natural number from 1 to 100 using a sum of consecutive natural numbers. For example, 9 = 2 + 3 + 4.

Print each sum in a file called *sums.txt*. If there is more than one way, use the one with the most addends (e.g. 15 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 instead of 15 = 7 + 8). If the sum is not possible, write that it is not possible (e.g. "16 is NOT possible.")

Your file should match *solutions.txt* exactly. Run the test to ensure that they are identical.

**Hint 1:** You can use the `sum()` function to find the sum of the items in a `list`, `range`, `set`, etc. if they contain only numbers. For example, `sum(range(6))` returns `15` since 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 equals 15.

**Hint 2:** You can break this problem up into smaller parts and make functions to solve those smaller parts. Once you have solved each part you can use those functions together.

**Hint 3:** You can use a [diff checker](https://www.diffchecker.com/) to compare two text files to see their differences.

## Criteria

* The Unit Test passes
* The solutions.txt file was not altered
* There is *at least one (1)* helpful line comment 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

When these criteria are met and you answer the questions in **sources.md**, you may submit this assignment.

If you submit this task without meeting these criteria, you will be asked to redo it and resubmit it.
