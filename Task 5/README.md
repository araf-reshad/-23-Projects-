## Before Starting This Task

It's recommended that you **only begin this task if you have already submitted Task #4.** It's okay if you are waiting for it to be marked.

## Instructions

Watch the following YouTube video *Lep Years: we can do better* by Matt Parker. 

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkt_wmRKYNQ)

Complete the flowchart in **flowchart.draw** to determine whether a year is a leap year using Matt Parker's improved version of the leap year system (there is a recap at 6:06 in the video). You can assume the year is at least 1752 (the first leap year).

After your flowchart is complete, create a program in **main.py** that prompts the user to enter a year, then prints whether or not that year is a leap year based on your flowchart.

Examples:

```
Enter a year: 1752
1752 is a leap year.
```
```
Enter a year: 1900
1900 is NOT a leap year.
```
```
Enter a year: 2000
2000 is a leap year.
```
```
Enter a year: 2019
2019 is NOT a leap year.
```
```
Enter a year: 2020
2020 is a leap year.
```
```
Enter a year: 2800
2800 is a leap year.
```
```
Enter a year: 12800
12800 is NOT a leap year.
```
```
Enter a year: 25600
25600 is NOT a leap year.
```
```
Enter a year: 2508400
2508400 is NOT a leap year.
```
```
Enter a year: 2508404
2508404 is a leap year.
```

## Criteria
* The Input/Output Tests pass
* Your program works as long as the user enters a positive integer greater than or equal to 1752

&nbsp;&nbsp;

When these criteria are met and you answer the questions in **sources.md**, you may submit this assignment.

If you submit this task without meeting these criteria, you will be asked to redo it and resubmit it.

## main.py

Here is the original code in **main.py** for reference:

```python
"""Please complete the flowchart before writing your code."""

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# Continue this program so that it prints whether the year is a leap year as described in the instructions
```
